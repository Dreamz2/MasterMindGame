# MasterMind Game
This java program is like **Master Mind** a code-breaking game for two players. Instead, it will be 
**Player** vs **Computer**. Also, because guessing a list of colours will take a long time, the 
player will be guessing digits 0-9 in the computer's lists. The player will have to enter the 
length of the list they are wanting to guess (2 inclusive to 10 exclusive). Once the length is entered, 
the computer will generate a random list of digits within the given length. The digits in the list are to 
be different from one another. The program will let the player continue playing until they want to stop.
Finally, print out average performance of all games played.
